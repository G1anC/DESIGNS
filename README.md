# Designs
This repository is filled with front-end designs made with Figma as trainings to see my web design level.

### Monet design

A training and a tribute to my favorite painter, Claude Monet.

### PortFolio

A re-iteration of my portfolio that fits me better but i don't have the time to develop/code it.

### Radiohead

Same as Claude Monet but for the ground-breaking group that is Radiohead.
